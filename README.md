### LLM-Overcooked
GPTsubmission Repository integrates the real-time decision-making capability of OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing you to test the performance of large language models in long-horizon planning problems. The usage of this repository is similar to the method described above, for more details refer to https://github.com/jidiai/Competition_OvercookedAI. Before running the code, make sure to replace "YOUR API KEY" with your own OpenAI API key. Please note that if you are an OpenAI free user, the ChatGPT interface will only provide one response every 20 seconds. Therefore, you may need to modify the value of time.sleep in overcooked_integrated.py accordingly.
